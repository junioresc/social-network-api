## Description

This application is a social media backend that allows you to create users, add friends, create thoughts and reactions. There are even friend counters that tally up how many friends you have and thoughts have a reaction counter. In the future, it would be great to add bcrypt to hash the users passwords, as currently you only need a username and an email to create a User.
